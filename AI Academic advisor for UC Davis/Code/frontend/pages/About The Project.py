    Advisor appointments are prone to getting backed up as the need for appointments spikes every registration period.
    UC Davis has around 30,000 undergraduates.
    This volume, combined with a developing and changing class catalog, can lead to an insufficient amount of time with your department advisor, especially if your meeting time is your first look and understanding of what courses are available to you and what they mean for your degree.
    In response to this, we created a website to have a preliminary look at your available courses before meeting with an advisor to have a more efficient meeting. While our website is not intended to be a replacement for an advisor, we hope that it is a helpful resource to ensure preparedness for a discussion with an advisor about your degree status and course map.
    On the other hand, advisors can benefit from a pre-screening resource for students, letting appointments and meetings begin at a more advanced point.
    Our objective is to create a tool that reliably displays what relevant courses are available for a student to take based on their course history, which is provided either by text or through a PDF transcript, in an easily interpretable format.
    We also incorporated an AI chatbot that handles advising questions and a degree tracking system.
